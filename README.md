1. Download Zip and extract.
2. Open Chrome/Brave settings.
3. Go to Extensions>Manage Extensions>Activate Developer Mode.
4. Click the Load unpacked and go to the directory for the extracted zip.

**HOW TO USE EXTENSION**

1. Once you are on Splice website and have sounds in Browse/Sounds.
2. First Select All Sounds if you don't want to just select a few.
3. If sounds NOT in library and you want to "buy" them - click "Add Selected to Library"
4. Then after that you can Download Selected. A white overlay will open when you download - at this point just let the extension work with clicking Download on each individual sample.
5. In this version there is no Auto-Clear - so after you have downloaded you should click "Clear" and "Clear All" which is the only Clear that works in this version.
6. Repeat steps 2-5.
